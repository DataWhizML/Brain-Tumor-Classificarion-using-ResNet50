## Introduction

Brain tumor classification is a critical task in medical image analysis, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning. This project leverages deep learning and convolutional neural networks to accurately classify brain MRI images as either containing a tumor or being tumor-free.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the BRATS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) Challenge, containing MRI scans from various medical institutions. The images are annotated to indicate the presence or absence of tumors, enabling supervised learning for classification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-classification.git
