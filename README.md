## Introduction

Brain tumor classification is a critical task in medical image analysis, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning. This project leverages deep learning and convolutional neural networks to accurately classify brain MRI images as either containing a tumor or being tumor-free.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the BRATS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) Challenge, containing MRI scans from various medical institutions. The images are annotated to indicate the presence or absence of tumors, enabling supervised learning for classification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-classification.git
   cd brain-tumor-classification

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook brain_tumor_classification.ipynb to train and evaluate the model.

2. Optionally, fine-tune the model architecture or hyperparameters based on specific requirements.

3. Evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

## Results

Utilizes ResNet50 with fine-tuning for classification.
Achieved impressive results: accuracy 98.9%, recall 99%, precision 98%.
